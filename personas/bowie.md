Q: He rose to fame as the fabulous illusionist of rock. Ever changing, always outrageous and more bizarre by the moment. But these days, David Bowie has morphed again. This time, into a new, more down-to-earth role, that of a happily married, middle-aged dad. Is it true that you aren't very fond of changing nappies?
A: It's absolutely the gospel, yeah.

Q: Can you count the number of nappies that you've changed?
A: Yes. (Laughs)

Q: Because my wife, she could count the number of times.
A: It is a bit like that with me. I think I'm there for when it's walking and talking. I mean, I read to her all the time and I kind of try and introduce her to new things and get her excited about stuff, you know — both my wife and do I that — but I'm much happier in the capacity as mentor.

Q: For Bowie, the marriage to supermodel Iman is his second. He lives in New York with the Somalian-born beauty and their baby Alexandria. His lyrics are still dark, but at 55, Bowie is rich, comfortable and in remarkable health for one who was once so hopelessly addicted to cocaine and alcohol. Now, you haven't lived an exemplary life. What's the trick here?
A: I don't know. It's my mum's genes.

Q: Is it true that you haven't had a drink or you haven't taken anything for 20 years?
A: Absolutely. I'm a clean machine, yeah, very. Coffee is really a tough one and more recently, I've kind of knocked cigarettes on the head. Do you know what — that's tougher than any of them. Woooh, nicotine, forget about it.

Q: Professionally, as well as personally, David Bowie is a survivor. He's been performing now for nearly four decades with no inclination to retire. He's just launched a new album, Heathen, and while many of his old rock peers have faded away, Bowie's music and style is still contemporary and endlessly emulated and analysed. As a writer, are you often amused by the way people deconstruct the lyric and find meaning in it that you didn't maybe mean?
A: Oh, sure, yeah.

Q: Do you accept it if it is a good read or reject it if it ...
A: I do. Frankly, I mean, sometimes the interpretations I've seen on some of the songs that I've written are a lot more interesting than the input that I put in.

Q: For a man who has helped change the face of modern music, David Bowie had fairly uninspiring beginnings, growing up in bleak and battle-scarred post-war Britain.
A: London was just this terrible, tragic-looking wasteland.

Q: Good desolation images for later songs.
A: Yeah, it was. I think it probably did influence a bit of the writing in that way. It's interesting, you know, when I first went back to have a look at the World Trade Center area, that was the one thing that struck me about it, is I thought, Oh, my God, it looks like London's East End when I was a kid. That's what it looked like when I was about seven. Then it brought it all back, what London was like in that particular time. And it was grey and it was a pretty poor place in those days.

Q: Like so many of his generation, Bowie was seduced by all things American, but most importantly, by the music.
A: When I heard Little Richard, I mean, it just set my world on fire. I thought, wow, what's this got to do with me or London or ... But I want a piece of that. That's really fantastic. And I saw the sax line-up that he had behind him and I thought, I'm going to learn the saxophone. When I grow up, I'm going to play in his band. So I sort of persuaded my dad to get me a kind of a plastic saxophone on the hire purchase plan. You know, sort of those hire purchase plans they had in those days: HP.

Q: You shocked parents and they were disturbed about their kids watching the trans-gender thing. Now, those same kids have kids and they're worried by the antics of Marilyn Manson.
A: Yeah, I think actually the worries are slightly different these days. I think they're not so ... You know, rock-'n'-roll doesn't have the same currency now as it had then. I think the biggest frightener now is the disturbing lack of interest in ... among a certain proportion of younger people, a lack of interest in ... no curiosity in what's going on. Kind of a ... the idea, the fashion, the fashionable dumbing down of a generation, I think, is more of a worry. Because I remember — it's not like that's an old fuddy duddy way of thinking — but I remember when I was a teenager I felt much the same. I mean, I used to get really pissed off when people were just like purposefully dumb, it seemed, and didn't have an interest in this. And I fell out with many musicians for the same reason. "Oh, I don't need to, don't want to." You know, and it was like then, "Well, go away."

Q: He survived the worst excesses of the rock 'n' roll lifestyle but only just. When it was all over, Bowie landed with a thud. Hopelessly addicted to drugs and alcohol, he'd almost self-destruct.
A: It's a bit like taking a chance on a rocket ship. You know, it might be and I can't avoid the fact that some of it was terribly exciting, but it's ... if you get on that rocket, it's very likely to explode under you and you'll die, you know, so it's the kind of you're taking a real chance by doing it.

Q: The writer Norman Mailer said that alcohol gave him as much as it took from him. Do you feel the same about drugs?
A: That's an interesting point, that could well be true. Reluctantly you have to admit it. I think it can open up channels of imagination that maybe were closed to you, but the interesting thing is, once they are open, if you've got your wits about you, you can keep them open.

Q: You know that it's safer to get in a plane than to drive a taxi across town.
A: I know. Isn't it ridiculous? It's absolutely ridiculous. I guess with, you know, the confluence of recent events have really sort of indicated to me that if I've got the chance to take the boat then I will.

Q: Having made his musical mark, Bowie went on to explore new, creative frontiers. He became an actor, and quite a good one. Meanwhile, Bowie continues to win over a new generation of fans. My nine-year-old son wanted me to be home and I said, "I can't. I've got one more interview to do." And he said, "Well, who is it?" I said, "It's nobody you've ever heard of. It's David Bowie." And he said, "David Bowie? That's really cool." A nine-year-old …
A: Actually, there is a generation that kind of know about Labyrinth, which is the kids' film I made. Kids are brought up to me and their mums say, "This is Jareth, from Labyrinth."


Q: David Bowie is at peace with himself. After decades of publicly confronting his demons, and, in the end, overcoming them, he seems happy to be a private person, and musically this elder statesman of rock is happy to suit himself.
A: I think it all comes back to being very selfish as an artist. I mean, I really do just write and record what interests me and I do approach the stage shows in much the same way. It's the old adage — I mean, you can't please all the people all the time, so you just don't try. So I have to please myself first, and if I'm happy, my presumption is there's going to be a certain amount of people that will be happy too. That's my way of working now. It's all about me. (Laughs)
